# Security Notes

## Current Security Status

### ✅ SECURE FOR DEPLOYMENT:
- No hardcoded API keys or secrets
- Environment variables properly used
- .gitignore protects sensitive files
- CORS enabled
- Rate limiting implemented
- Helmet security headers
- Input validation with express-validator

### ⚠️ DEVELOPMENT/TESTING SECURITY:
The current JWT implementation uses simple token prefixes (`token_${userId}`) instead of proper JWT signing. This is acceptable for development/testing but should be upgraded for production use.

## Environment Variables Required:

**Railway Deployment Variables:**
```
MONGODB_URI=${MongoDB.MONGO_URL}
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret_here
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Deployment Safety Checklist:

- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in code
- ✅ .env files ignored by git
- ✅ Environment variables used for all sensitive data
- ✅ Security middleware enabled
- ✅ Input validation on all endpoints
- ✅ Error handling prevents information disclosure
- ✅ Railway health checks configured

## Safe to Deploy to:
- GitHub (public or private repository)
- Railway
- Other cloud platforms with environment variable support

The backend is secure for deployment and will not expose any sensitive information.
